<h1># LJ Code 201 - Day 1</h1>

It is the first learning journal. I gotta say there is more lecturing than I thought there would be, but then again it is the beginning. I can't wait to sink my teeth into mind numbing coding practices. Well Nick says it will ramp up and I am sure he isn't yanking my chain. I will need to brush up on my HTML and CSS as I assumed it would be more Javascript based on how much the 102 class emphasized it. That and terminal, I have fiddled around with it a little but I don't feel comfortable with it.
